# GoogleCalendar Automation 

This project aims to automate Google Calendar events with Calendar API and Chrome History database. 

# How it works

1) Copy History file from Google Chrome to the project directory.
2) You currently need to add credentials.json, the reason this is not in the github because it includes sensitive information.
3) To run: enter python3 main.py
